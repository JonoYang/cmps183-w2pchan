Final project: a 4chan-like imageboard using web2py

URL: [w2pchan](http://w2pchan.pythonanywhere.com)

## Team:
- Jonathan Yang (jyang37@ucsc.edu)
- Steven Esser (sesser@ucsc.edu)

## About:
w2pchan was designed to be a clone of the imageboard 4chan.org. 
It has various topic boards which are admin controlled. 

In each board, there are multiple user created threads relating 
that board's topic. All threads must contain an image, though 
subsequent posts in a thread do not have this requirement. 

Users can post text, images, or images and text in combination. 
Each user's post is in response to a particular thread, or in 
response to another post. 

## Notes:
General website layout and style is based off of 4chan.org's safe-for-work boards.
